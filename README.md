A machine learning project that predicts house prices in Bengaluru using real estate attributes such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms. The project covers the full ML pipeline — data cleaning, feature engineering, model building, evaluation, and optional deployment using Flask or Streamlit.

🧠 Modeling Approach

Several algorithms were experimented with:

Linear Regression

Lasso / Ridge Regression

Decision Tree Regressor

Random Forest

K-Fold Cross Validation

The best-performing model is saved as a pickle file for prediction

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-Learn

Jupyter Notebook

Flask / Streamlit

How to run :

step 1 : Open this repo in your code editior and import all the extensions

step 2 : First you need to run the ./server server.py file.

step 3 : After step 2 run the ./client app.html file 

step 4 : You have to enter the requriments and you will get the estimated price
